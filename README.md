# TechFluent-Report
**`Techfluent Report 2.0.pbix`**: Using the AdventureWorks2017 dataset, I analyzed pricing and regional trends, with varying levels of granularity.
Created ETL pipelines, cleaned and transformed data from multiple sources
Applied DAX measures, calculated columns, and custom time intelligence (e.g., DateDim tables)
Developed interactive dashboards to display KPIs and performance over time.

The 2 .png files `BI report Techfluent.png` and `Power BI Techfluent 2.png`are screenshots of the report.
